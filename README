IRC Hyperic Plugin

Note: This is a community contributed plugin and is not
officially supported by VMware. Please seek help
via the community forums.

This plugin has only been tested against InspIRCd (www.inspircd.org) 
though it should work against any server that returns "Looking up your hostname"
upon connecting to it.
